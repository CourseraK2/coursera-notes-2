# A Beginner's Guide to Irrational Behavior (Study Guide)

This is meant to be a personal study guide for the April 2013 Coursera-offered Duke University course offered by Professor Dan Ariely. It contains my own notes on lectures and recommended/required readings for the course. In addition, I also included links to other students' notes or visualizations of the lectures that I thought were incredibly useful or impressive in context. In such cases, the captions or citations for those will clearly provide attribution to the sources.


### Web Book Boilerplate

This is also an experiment in using Pascal Precht's ([Github](http://github.com/PascalPrecht) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/PascalPrecht)) awesome "Web Book Boilerplate" to generate a digital book version of these notes. Given that I do almost all my reading on a Kindle (device or application) these days, having a quick and easy way to create .mobi and .epub versions of the notes seems the way to go.

For more on Web Book Boilerplate see the [wiki](https://github.com/WebBooks/wbb/wiki) or follow [Web Books on Twitter](http://twitter.com/webbooks_org)

## Building from source

* Read the WebBooks [wiki](https://github.com/WebBooks/wbb/wiki) for correct environment setup
* Clone or download the distribution
* Use "npm install" to ensure all dependencies are fulfilled (including grunt)
* Use "grunt wbb:html" to generate the HTML version of the book
* Other formats supported include wbb:epub, wbb:rtf and wbb:mobi
