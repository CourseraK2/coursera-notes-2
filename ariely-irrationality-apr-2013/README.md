# A Beginner's Guide to Irrationality

This was the introductory course to behavioral economics that was launched in April 2013 on Coursera. It is taught by Prof. Dan Ariely, a unique individual with an uncanny way of making irrationality in human behaviors seem logical. The course is heavy on reading and terminology but it is without doubt one of those courses that I want to really do justice to. This is my attempt to do so by taking on the **"sponge vs. roomba"** challenge. Sponges are passive participants who soak up knowledge but rarely take the effort to actively explore the area or apply the learnings. Roombas are by nature exploratory beasts that constantly move around trying to get maximum coverage of the domain. At least that's how I look at it.

Since I discovered Markdown, I find it an extremely useful format for capturing study notes and comments. This repo will contain my notes on both study materials and reading recommendations for this course. Updates will be out-of-order by necessity (my earlier notes were captured on a combination of Google Docs and Paper - so transcription will occur over time).
