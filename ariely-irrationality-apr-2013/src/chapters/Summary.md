# Summary

A crowd-sourced collection of Lecture Notes and Readings commentary can be found on this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2513bX-TLduS2ZaV0E1dnp4c00&usp=sharing) - it was a collective effort by participants to provide coverage of the topics and was universally held to be the best idea/resource for the class.

There are separate chapters (pages) for each topic which combine lecture-slide notes (directly) with my annotations or additions based on my understanding of the topic. While the initial goal was to support study needs for the course, the long-term goal is to expand on these topics as I find examples/usage of the concepts in my own life.

**Dishonesty**

**Labor and Motivation**

**Self Control**

**Emotion**

Emotions are a basic part of human nature. They can work for us, or against us (duality).  They can also overtake cognition. The key to better decision-making is to understand how and why emotions influence us and design interventions to maximize the benefits of emotional decisions.

1. Brain has 2 sides: Limbic (emotional), Cognitive (logical).All animals have Limbic regions. Humans differ in cognition.
3. Emotions are transient and more short-lived than we expect e.g., the "Tenure" study on happiness/misery.
4. Emotions can overtake cognition. e.g., "cold" and "hot" conditions trigger different "risk" responses. More likely to engage in immoral behavior when aroused. More likely to donate to water-based charity causes after working out (when you are thirsty)

5. **Intra-Empathy**: Empathy is about feeling camaraderie for others. Intra-empathy is about feeling camaraderia with your own future self.
6. Intra-Empathy Mismatch: We find it harder to predict/reconcile our future decisions under a different emotional state, with current thinking.
7. The Trolley Problem: Cognitive vs. Emotional disconnect when asked to save 4 lifes vs. 1 life by pulling a lever to re-route a runaway trolley.  Cognitive (cold state) response favors 4 lives, but Emotional (hot state, where you know the face of the 1 person) overturns logic.

8. **Identifiable Victim Effect**: A single, specific victim inspires action but general information about masses does not (the statistical vs. identifiable life). Helping distant strangers is economically irrational and requires empathy (emotion) not statistics (logic). Adding computational terms dampens the emotional response (moves problem out of emotional zone into cognitive zone for decision-making)
9. Designing Interventions: Important to represent the problem in a manner that will (a) get people to take action (short-term goals) and (b) get people to "care" (long-term benefits)

10. **Emotional Decision-Making**: Experiment with asking people to select jam/posters based on (a) emotion and (b) cognitive information about the item -- showed people tended to consume (eat/pin-up) more items they bought based on emotion.
11. Product Marketing: It is important to have the *decision environment* (context in which the consumer makes a decision e.g., store) match the *consumption environment* (context in which consumer uses the product e.g., home) -- if consumption is emotionally-driven (e.g., requires enjoyment of the senses) then decision-making should be emotionally-driven too.

12. **Risk Assessment**: Our perception of risk is higher when (a) the event is salient in memory (e.g., recent news/entertainment coverage) and (b) we have an emotional response to it. This in turn may cause us to overestimate the risk when making related decisions.
