# Lecture 6: Emotion

Two sides to decision-making: rational and emotions. When emotions take over, they can eliminate the rational side.

## Two Systems (20:25)

1. Two sides to the brain: *Limbic* (internal, emotional) and *Cognitive*(external, thoughtful)

2. Useful to think about emotional system as 'rapid response' to inputs e.g., fright/flight/fight where we don't want to think, we just want to act/react and execute an action in response to external stimuli.

3. All animals have Limbic systems but humans have a more evolved Cognitive system. However, emotions are often stronger (more deep-rooted) than cognition.

4. Quale (singular) or Qualia (plural) = feeling of emotion. Refers to internal and subjective component of sense perceptions that arise from the stimulation of senses by phenomena.

5. *Why do we need emotions?* -- Not about the moment (now) but rather about planning (future). By giving users a deep-rooted feeling, it provides long-term context for remembering and reacting to the similar situations.\

6. *How do emotions work?* -- They are more primitive, faster and executed based on environment. They can be moderated by cognitive processes but they are in fact **transitory** and more short-lived than we expect.

7. *Affective forecasting* Dan Gilbert (Harvard) performed experiments to illustrate that happiness fades faster than we expect. "Emotional adaptation" implies that we return to some base or normal emotional state even after big changes to our emotional context.
   Experiment: Professors asked how getting/being-denied tenure would affect them. Most predicted a long-term happiness (on tenure) or misery (on denial) -- but in reality, most returned rather quickly to their previous state. Other examples: the joys of moving, the sorrows of dating and breaking up.


EXPERIMENT: To prove that emotions can overtake cognition.

1. (Objective) Conducted survey with subjects to look at the effect of sexual arousal (considered a basic emotion) on a user's cognitive attitudes to (a) sexual preferences (simple or quirky), (b) willingness to take risk (e.g., practice safe sex), and (c) willingness to act immorally (e.g., ethical in approaching others for sex)  .

2. (Process) Subjects asked to answer questions in two different states: (a) A *cold* condition where they simply sat and answered them, and (b) a *hot* condition where they were first shown suggestive imagery or otherwise put into a heightened state of arousal.

3. (Result) Students who acted safely and in risk-averse ways in the cold condition, showed a propensity to change their responses and have a higher willingness to act in unsafe or immoral ways when aroused.

4. (Example) *Purity Pledge* -- studies showed thay people who sign purity pledges are more likely to catch STDs. Why? Because they make the decision in a cognitive state (cold) and don't prepare for (or anticipate) situations where they could break their pledge (e.g., when in an emotional state).

5. (Relevance) It is hard for people in "cold" states to empathize with behaviors taken in "hot" states -- to do so, we need to understand how emotion can *change* our behaviors or our decision-making. Note that this is not an excuse for criminal behavior, but perhaps more of a context for understanding such impulses and designing more effective interventions.


## Intra-empathy Mismatch (3:48)

1. *The Intra-Empathy Gap.* We find it harder to make predictions about *our* future actions under an emotional state and typically mis-predict our behavior. Typically, empathy refers to our feelings/responses to others' behavior. However, intra-empathy refers to our feelings about our own.

2. Example: People often think they want to watch high-class "quality" movies (e.g., classics). But when they go to watch a movie, they are not acting on "principle", but on emotion -- and they end up watching lighter or more entertaining "popcorn" movies.

3. Example: Lowenstein asked people at gym about their willingness to support charities (e.g., water). Found that in cold state (just starting workout) people were not as empathetic but as they worked out (and were thirstier) they were more likely to donate to water-related causes. Note that food-related causes did not cause empathy in this context, only water-related ones.

4. Proposal: We might have more success in raising money for hunger or food-related causes if we solicit hungry people -- i.e., delay food service at charity dinners.

## The Identifiable Victim Effect (16:38)

*The Trolley Problem*

1. A train approaches an intersection but is heading towards the track with 4 people on it. You have the power to pull a lever to divert the train to the other track (which only has 1 person on it). Do you pull the lever? Most people say yes. Saving 4 people at the cost of 1 life is the better option.

2. But now, suppose you had a person standing next to you on a bridge above the track and could push him onto the path of the train to stop it from hitting the 4 people -- again the trade-off is 4 lives vs. 1 life. Would you do it? Most people say no. They don't have the guts to do this. Would it make a difference if you pushed him while facing him (eye-contact) or not? People have differing opinions.

3. Underscores discrepancy between cognitive and emotional thinking. Cognitive = logic (4 lives > 1 life). Emotion = feeling (1 life > 4 lives because we care about the 1 person).

*Mismatched Money and Need*

1. Looks at "funding-generated vs. number-affected" for various disasters from 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, Asian Tsunami, Tuberculosis, AIDS and Malaria. There is a negative correlation - Katrina affected 2M but achieved 3200M in funding, while Malaria affects 300M but gets only 200M in funding. Why?

2. Things that could contribute to this mismatch: proximity to the US, racial/economic strata etc. Or they are closer to you because you can envision someone you know being a victim.

3. The Identifiable Victim effect: We care more about suffering when it is represented by one individual (face of the problem) but care to a lesser degree when the problem is wide-spread. Example Quotes: (Stalin) One man's death is a tragedy. A million deaths is a statistic. (Mother Theresa) If I look at the masses, I will never act, if I look at the individual I will.

4. (Example) You are dressed for an interview and you see a toddler drowning -- would you jump in to save her? Of course! Instead, ask yourself: would you put aside a little money to save a toddler from starving? Maybe. But what if this was one in a million toddlers and you didn't see or hear her cries? Probably not.

EXPERIMENT: Statistical vs. Identifiable Life

1. Research shows that when soliciting donations for world hunger, people were willing to donate *twice as much* to "Rokia" whos is representative of the problem (identifiable), than they would if just shown the masses (statistics).

2. What happens when you combine both (i.e., show a face, but ask for donations to support that person AND additional "x" people?). Result: Donations go down ($1.14 for statistical, $2.38 for identifiable, $1.43 for both)

3. Experiment: Showed users a photo with 8 kids and asked for donations for them. Users in condition 1 told that once their donation was given, a specific child would be chosen. Users in condition 2 told that a child had been randomly selected for them already before asking for donation. Result: people more likely to help in condition 2.

Helping distant strangers is economically irrational -- it requires empathy (emotion) not computation (logic). Adding statistical data dampens our emotional response. It's almost as if introducting data moves us away from emotional decisions to cognitive thinking. Merely thinking in computational terms dampens our emotional response.

Identifiable victim effect is why people respond less to genocide or issues like mad cow disease, where problems were described in the "total" rather than with an "individual" face. In the latter case, it took a cute calf photo to trigger public action to revise the intervention policy. It is important to know how to "Represent" a large problems in ways that will get people to act. And how can we represent the problem in a "persuasive" manner that won't just get people to act (short-term) but actually get people to care (long-term).


## Emotional Decision Making (10:16)

1. Baby Jessica Story: Toddler fell into a well and was rescued. Received more coverage than Rwanda and Darfur combined. People donated to her *after* she was rescued -- why didn't genocide create this level of long-term interest? Again, the identifiable victim effect: imagery of one trumps statistics of many.

2. The Spam Story: Spammers try to create an emotional link with user by using a "story" e.g., by connecting with end user via some trusted source (e.g., bulletin boards) and create a relationship. But why do so many spam letters have poor grammar? Suggests it is deliberate -- spammers want to keep "gullible" people in their system and filter out those less likely to be productive targets for their schemes. By using poor grammar, they can be more assured that respondents are 'gullible' and less critical. Evidence of this is just beginning to emerge. Spamming is a good way to learn about human behavior since it obtains data from large populations.

EXPERIMENT:
1. Subjects asked "What do you like? Pick what you like" for two kinds of products -- Jam and Posters. Afterwards, the subjects were revisited to find out how they liked their choice: did they consume the jam? did they hang up the poster?

2. Two cases were explored: In case A, subjects were just shown the products and asked to go with their emotions. In case B, subjects were given statistics and additional information (cognitive input) about products. Result: Subjects who picked items based on emotional input alone tended to "consume" that item (e.g., ate the jam or hung the poster) more/better than those who selected it based on cognitive input.

3. Why? Because a lack of cognitive input can increase the enjoyment of products that are intrinsically consumed using emotions (e.g., sense of taste, sight). Thus the ideal is for the *decision environment* to match the *consumption environment* in order to maximize consumption pleasure.

4. Example 2: (Chris Hsee) When purchasing speakers -- comparing them 'side-by-side' at a store, tiny differences in quality seem more important than the appearance. But now at home, there is no "relative sound comparison" and the appearance begins to matter more. So, again, think about the consumption environment (home) when designing the decision environment (store)

## Risk Assessment (6:28)

1. Risk Assessment is Emotion-driven: How do your emotions affect your beliefs regarding the risk of death? Paul Slovic study: Tragedies that were most recently covered (in news) are more salient in our minds and we *over-estimate* the risks there.

2. Example: Are you more likely to die from falling airplane parts or shark attacks? More pick shark-attacks because they are more salient in popular culture (movies) rather than reality.

3. Example: People ask Dan if he is afraid to travel home (to Israel). Death toll from car crashes is 400 times greater than that caused by terrorism (2005). But because terror attacks are intentional and beyond your control, the emotional response to them is sharper, and causes more fear.

4. Takeway: Our perception of risk is higher when (a) the event is salient in memory (e.g., recent news/entertainment coverage) and (b) we have an emotional response to it.

5. All emotions are not equal. Some emotions (arousal, fear, hunger) are stronger than others. The power of emotions to influence us depends on how *primary* they are -- as opposed to, say, how social they are (e.g., embarassment). The more primary/visceral, the more likely they are to influence our actions.
