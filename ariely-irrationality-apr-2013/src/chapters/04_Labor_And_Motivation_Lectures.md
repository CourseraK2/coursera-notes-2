# Lecture 4: Labor and Motivation

How much of motivation is driven purely by reward?

## Extrinsic versus Intrinsic Motivation (16:58)

* Many possible sources of motivation: pride, reputation, camaraderie, altruism, meaning, sense of purpose (fulfillment), *money* etc.

* Even though mountain climbing can be miserable, people continue to repeat the experience.
   * What if you knew you would never reach the top? (Futility)
   * what if you knew you woudn't remember it? (Meaning)

* Money is not necessarily the best motivator. People derive value from a wide range of sources.
   * Example: Paid employee finds efforts were discarded (merger cancelled) - was demotivated at work.
   * The purpose and "actual use" contributes to the meaning of work

* Issue of Meaning: We are motivated to do things that we find meaningful.
   * Meaningful Condition = Work has clear utility or with at least an illusion of value (progress)
   * Sissyphean Condition = Work with clearly no utility (repetitive, no sense of progress)

* Experiment with Bionicles:
    * Participants paid in decreasing amounts for each Lego Bionic assembled. Told Bionics would be re-used for each participant (hinting no long-term value).
    * Tested to see how many bioncles they would build under different conditions: Deferred (completed bionicles put in box for delayed destruction), Immediate (completed bionicles torn down instantly).
    * At what point was building the next Bionicle not worth it? How did it differ for people who loved Legos (passion) vs. those who didn't (ambivalent)
    * Result: Meaningful conditions created 4 more bionicles than Sissyphean. More importantly, people who loved Legos built more in the Meaningful condition but were on par with others in the Sissyphean -- indicating that a lack of meaning can suck out the joy in doing something you really liked.
    * Participants in the Sissyphean condition also had higher "Reservation wages" for the work (i.e., they were willing to do it only at higher money and quit earlier when wages went down)

* The Consultant Experiment: Third party asked to predict outcomes did correctly identify meaningful over sissyphean -- but underestimated the magnitude of the difference (predicted 1x, was 4x)

## Meaning (4:13)

   * Handling meaning in the workplace: Example of CEO who cancelled project at the last minute and demotivate masses of employees. How could CEO have re-instated meaning and motivation?
      * have people present it to the company
      * built prototypes
      * fit aspects of their technology into other projects
   * Purpose and meaning are so important they deserve substantial investment of time and money

## Acknowledgement (3:31)

   * Meaning beyond Money: How much does acknowledgement of effort matter?

   * Pairs-of-Letters Experiment: asked to identify pairs of letters in sheet, paid per sheet with decreasing returns (55c for 1st sheet, down to 25c for last one)
      * acknowledged (wrote names against submissions, got it looked-over, saw a nod),
      * ignored (wrote no names, got no feedback - saw submission just added to a pile)
      * shredded (wrote no names, saw submission instantly destroyed with no feedback)
   * Acknowledged did ~9 vs. ~6.5 for other conditions (30% better). Ignored and Shredded conditions were statistically similar

   * Take-away:
      * it is relatively easy to acknowledge people's work and make them feel good
      * in contrast, simply ignoring people is as demotivating as destroying it in front of them

## IKEA Effect (11:49)

   * How does labor lead to love?

   * The Egg Theory:
       * The Cake Mix Conundrum: Why did initial instant "cake mixes" not sell?
       * People (cooks) had a sense of pride about serving something they made with effort and disdained having a "pre-cooked" item as the exclamation point (dessert) for a meal.
       * Cake mixes were re-packaged asking cooks to add eggs/milk separately, incurring effort to make the final product - and sold.
       * The minimal effort to add milk/eggs to the cake mix makes us value the cake more.

   * Paper cranes and Origami experiment:
      * Creators vs. Observers -- creators assembled/made paper cranes from origami instructions. Now creators and impartial observers both rated the "price" they would pay for the finished creation.
      * Creator conditions: Easy (got instructions) and Hard (instructions were missing or unreadable)
      * Result: No creation was 'perfect' (amateurs) and hard creations were likely to be less so. Observers agreed, rating easy creations low and hard creations lower. By contrast, creators rated their efforts highly (more than a factor of 2X) compared to observers, with the hard creations being valued more than the easy ones.
      * More labor led to more love only when the participants were able to *complete* creations. (Take-way message for why this concept doesn't transition to tasks like tailoring which require a lot of effort and could remain incomplete simply due to time or complexity)

  * The IKEA Effect in Parenting
     * We see kids as the product of our hard work and efforts. They may not be perfect but they are highly rated in our eyes because of the labor of love we put into them.
     * Consequently, we are also blind to their faults or to the perspectives of others as it relates to them.

  * The IKEA Effect in Personalization
     * Customization can be about more than simply reflecting personal preferences (blue vs. green)
     * It can also be reflective of the effort we invest in personalization, which increases liking

  * Takeaway: Putting effort into labor can increase our liking/love for the outcome. But too much effort can have negative consequences (e.g., when we don't finish and get frustrated) so we need to strike the right balance.

## Not-Invented-Here Bias (9:36)

 * Are you overly committed to your own ideas?

 * People liked their solutions better than ours -- why?
     * Perhaps Their solutions were better
     * Perhaps they had an idiosyncratic fit.
     * How can we validate this?

 * Experiment: Had people propose answers to the question: "How can communities reduce the amount of water they use without imposing tough restrictions?"
     * Participants asked to choose from a list of words (selecting a subset from list we gave)
     * Participants liked their ideas better (even though we 'put the words in their mouth'
     * Why? Not "better" or "idiosyncratic" -- simply their owning the act of creation.

 * Experiment Redux: Took a known solution (sentence) and jumbled up the words -- asked participants to come up with an answer using the given words (knowing there was only 1 solution)
     * Participants still liked their own response.
     * Investing even a small amount of energy makes people like the outcomes more.

 * The Toothbrush Theory: You love your own and hate others'. Why? Because you invested effort and use it exclusively.

 * The Not Invented Here (NIH) Bias:
     * Pro: Results in more time and passion devoted to our ideas
     * Con: Hinders our ability to consider other ideas

## Cognitive Dissonance (5:00)

 * Why would Zappos pay people to turn down a job?
     * Retaining happy/motivated employees and eliminating others ensures quality customer service
     * Cognitive Dissonance: The tension that exists when there is a mismatch between our beliefs and our behaviors
     * When we work harder for something, we convince ourselves we love it more.
     * Zappos gives 48 hrs for decision: take $2000 and leave, or join us. Zappos employees remember that they gave up 2K and justify it by telling themselves they must really love the job more.


## Monetary Stress and Performance (22:01)

  * Is work aversive? Do people work only for money?

  * Contrafreeloading: Almost all animals like working to some degree -- experiments with rodents showed they preferred to eat more from a food source that required effort (pressing a lever) than one that was provided free (open dish). The exception was the domestic cat.

  * Money is an important motivator. Do bonuses (performance-based incentives) motivate people to work harder?
     * Yerkes Dodson Effect: Inverted-U curve when mapping performance (Y) to incentives (X). Experiment used light shocks (negative incentive or penalty) to observe rat performances in navigating a maze. As shock levels increased, rats were more motivated to find/take safe routes; but once shock level crossed a threshold, rats' performance dropped.

  * Do bonuses affect performance? The India Experiment and Yerkes-Dodson Effects
     * 6 experiments (games) for different amounts of money (based on roll of a die)
     * Tried loss aversion by pre-paying: didn't work as well (participant choked, absconded with money)
     * Instead used payout on completion.
     * Do mechanical tasks work differently than mental ones? Yes: Mechanical (typing) performance increased with incentive.
     * Highest quality performance requires a state of flow (cogntive focus, complete concentration) -- high bonuses create distractions that impair cognitive focus and decrease performance.

## Social Stress and Performance (8:11)

  * Social concerns add to financial motivation when working in a group. But anxiety caused by public pressure impedes performance
     * Golfers playing against Tiger Woods fared worse due to public pressure
     * Are Bankers the same way? Didn't participate in experiments - so used basketball clutch players (high performance under high pressure) as focus

  * Basketball players
     * Clutch players had better *performance* (points) compared to others at the End of the Game (high-stress situation) but were comparable to others at the end of the first half (low-stress)
     * Was it because they were immune to Yerkes-Dodson? No. It was just that they took more shots at the end of the game (took more risks) and their absolute performance increased but their relative performance (#scored vs #attempted) remained the same.
     * Perhaps this is because they are more heavily defended? (Coaches still believe clutch players perform better under pressure) -- No. Looking at free throw percentages (high-stress situations with no defenders), they performed similar to others.

## Bonuses, Labor and Motivation (11:48)

 * Money is only one aspect of motivation
    * Small amounts of money can move relationship from social to monetary domains (e.g., parents and daycare "fines")
    * Large amounts can increase motivation but decrease performance (Yerkes-Dodson effect)
    * Humans do not operate on simple ideas of rewards. (Meaning, Acknowledgement, Stress, Love/Effort .. all play roles)

 * What other ways can we motivate people?
     * Thoughtful gifts?

 * Karl Marx vs. Adam Smith
     * Adam Smith: focus on efficiency. Performance improves when work is distributed and each worker specializes in one aspect. Led to production-line thinking but workers did not individually get to "see" the finished result of their work.
     * Karl Marx: focus on meaning. People are more connected to the output when there is meaning.
