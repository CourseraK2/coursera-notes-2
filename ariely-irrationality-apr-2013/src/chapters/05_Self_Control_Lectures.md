# Lecture 5: Self Control

What is the role of self-control in overcoming challenges in our lives and in our decision-making?

## Difficulty with Self-Control (16:46)

 * Present Focus Bias: Tendency to give more weight to our current environment or state.
     * Challenge: How to motivate behaviors for long-term benefit if they have short-term drawbacks?
     * Example: Interferon regimen for treating Hepatitis C. Would you make yourself sick on purpose (short-term side effects of treatments) to prevent cirrhosis (long-term benefits?)

 * Why do we pick half-box of chocolates today (over full box in a week) -- but reverse our decision if the options are half-box in a year and full-box in a year-and-a-week? Because we believe we will have better control/behavior in the distant future, but not right now.
      * Relative Importance of Things in Life: Some things (liver health) are more important than others (side effects of treatment) but we discount this importance because of the time component (short-term pain vs. long-term gain).

 * Example: Global Warming. Why Climate Change maxmizes human apathy?
      * It is far in the future
      * It affects others first
      * We do not see its progression
      * We don't see a particular person suffering
      * Individual efforts are a drop in the bucket

 * Reward Substitution: A trick we play to overcome such discounting effects by using an *alternate* reward that is immediate and therefore more motivating.
     * Well known concept in game design -- e.g., leaderboard recognition as motivation
     * Can we use reward substitution to encourage green behaviors? money, convenience, recognition.
     * The Toyota Prius Effect: Provides social rewards (ego boost)

 * Reward substituion can get us to act like we care about the world (or long-term effects) when we really care about our self-image (short-term impact)


## Reward Substitution (12:46)

  * Coumadin Study:
     * Significantly reduces the risk of stroke, has relatively few side effects BUT still has low compliance. Why? Something wrong in the 'incentive' system for taking coumadin
     * Can we measure compliance? Yes -- Internet pill-box records context of pill consumption
     * Can we reward/punish using measurements? -- Pay/Charge them? Guilt via kids? Competition? ...
     * Options: Take $3/day to take medication? "Supersize" incentive using loss aversion (where loss of money has higher magnitude than gaining same amount) -- take away money for not taking? What about $100 for a period of time? What about social rewards -- medication tied to specific kid being fed in Africa?
     * Lottery: The Ideal Lottery: one big low-probability reward + many small rewards that are more attainable
     * Regret: if the contrast between two outcomes is salient, the pain of loss is higher -- e.g., Olympic silver medallist vs. bronze medallist. Silver compares to gold winner (how close did I get!!) while bronze compares to all non-winners (how many did NOT get this?) - so bronze winner is happier
  * Experiment: Addressed Coumadin compliance with a "Regret Lottery"
     * everyone gets a ticet
     * only those who took medication on time get to claim a prize (if they win)
     * medication adherence went up 98-99% with regret lotteries

Takeaway: Many ways to maximize rewards without explicit costs
  * lotteries
  * regret
  * randomization
  * counterfactual thinking
  * reward substitution

## Ulysses Contracts (11:09)

 * Self-control (Ulysses) contracts
     * You know you will be tempted
     * You bind your current selt to prevent your future self from misbehaving

 * Experiment:
     * Pigeons shown Green Button (immediate, 1-pellet reward) and Purple Button (deferred, 10 pellet reward) ended up choosing Green.
     * Pigeons now shown a third Red Button which turns OFF the Green button (removes temptation to go for immediate reward) -- ended up choosing the Red button.
     * Even animals understand the need for self-control

 * Two states of being:
     * Naive: unaware of having a self-control problem
     * Sophisticated: aware of lack of self-control, takes proactive steps to resist/avoid temptation

## The Importance of Self-Control: The Individual and the Environment (13:48)

 * The Marshmallow Challenge: Kids given a marshmallow, promised a second one if they waited 20 minutes to eat the first one.
     * Kids who were able to resist the marshmallow did better in college
     * Ability to resist temptation also reflected in better physical health, less criminal activity, more financial stability

  * Is self-control a skill (learned) or an innate ability (born)?
     * When we distract ourselves from temptation, we are more likely to resist it
     * Ego Depletion: When we continually exert self-control, our ability to resist temptation weakens

  * How much does self-control depend on innate ability, and how much on "Tricks" we develop to enhance those abilities?
  * How much does self-control suffer as we are tempted throughout the day?
  * What role do rules play in regulating our behavior?

  * Human Mortality attributed to "bad decisions" jumped 5X from 1900 to 2000. Why? Because technological advances create more and more opportunities for us to succumb to temptation.

  * Experiment: The Denver Drug Program attempted to help heroin addicts recover. Employed Ulysses contracts
     * required addicts to write a self-incriminating letter to the person they did NOT want to find out about their habits
     * sent the letters if the agreement was violated
     * imposed a three-week waiting period - and after that, most subjects complied with the contract

  * Take-away:
     * Ulysses contracts: must be binding to be effective. It is difficult to study Ulysses contracts because researchers are *required* to let participants leave the study at any time.
     * Self-control: We must find a balance between amount of freedom we crave and the controls we need to shield us from temptation
