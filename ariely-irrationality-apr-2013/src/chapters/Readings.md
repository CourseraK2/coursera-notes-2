# Readings

Page counts are provided after each link **in bold** and are indicative of the page-counts in my copies of those papers. For online articles (e.g., New York Times) the page-count is for a "printable PDF" of the article. My notes are likely to be more comprehensive for shorter articles (< 10 pages) which I would have had more time to read in full, with longer articles meriting only a brief summary based on a quick scan-pass of the document.

**EMOTION: Required**

1. *Psychic Numbing and Mass Atrocity.*
[Link](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1809951) (**18 pages**)

```
Inaction of Bystanders: Why do people/governments fail to react to genocide and mass-scale human rights violations?

Lessons From Psychology:
  * Affect (=sense that something is good or bad) conveys meaning to information, and motivates action.
  * Dual-Process Theory = we perceive dual reality: System 1 (experiential) and System 2 (rational) where the latter (analysis) is important to decision-making but the former (intuition) makes navigating complex paths easier/quicker and more efficient.
  * Affect drives moral intuition, which influences moral judgements on situations like genocide. So is affect deficiency to blame for apathy to mass atrocities?

Affect, Analysis and Value of Human Lives:
  * Boils down to quantifying the value of human life. Brains think of numbers in a logarithm-like scale.
  * *Weber's Law*: For stimulus (affect) to be noticeable, a fixed percentage must be added. Thus, we notice small changes in small contexts but require extremely large changes to garner equal affect in large contexts.
  * *Psychophysical Function*: characterizes the diminished sensitivity to a wide range of perceptual or cognitive entities (stimuli) as their underlying magnitude changes.
  * *Psychophysical Numbing*: reflects our inability to appreciate losses of life as they become larger in magnitude.
  * *Prospect Theory:* refers to decision-making under uncertainity. Defines a value function that relates a subjective value to actual gains/losses. When Prospect Theory is applied to human lives (in contexts like genocide) the value function indicates that the subjective value of a *specific* number of lives is greater in the context of a smaller tragedy, than it is for a larger one.

  * Intervention vs. Apathy: Studies show that *proportion* of lives saved causes more weight than the *absolute* number of lives saved, when people evaluate intervention actions.

Numbers and Numbness
  * Apathy not explained completely by psychophysical numbing.  What else is at play?
  * Identifiable Victim effect. Face/identity elicits more compassion than statistics.
  * Can personalized media coverage of genocide victims overcome apathy? Perhaps. Study showed that identifiable life garnered more compassion (donation) than statistical life, but when both were combined, the compassion (donation) dropped. Either statistics suppressed emotion, or they enhanced awareness of the many *not* being helped and created negative affects that inhibited responses.
  * **Compassion Fatigue** EXPERIMENT: Subjects primed to either remember emotions or perform calculations; the former donated more than the latter to an identifiable victim but there was no difference between them in donating to statistical victims.

2. *Dread Risk, September 11, and Fatal Traffic Accidents.*
[Link](https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/behavioralecon/readings/Week%206%20Readings/9-11_Dread_2004.pdf) (**4 pages**)

```
Dread risks are low-probabilty, high-consequence events such as 9/11 where many people's lives are lost in a single moment rather than in a distributed manner over time.

 * People may take extreme measures to avoid dread risks. But such measures may actually cost lives. In this paper, authors formulate this hypothesis and try to prove it using travel data post 9/11.

 * Dread Hypothesis: 9/11 was a dread risk. If Americans reduced air travel as a result, and a proportion of those now drove, then hypothesis is that traffic fatalities increased.
 * Direct evidence for part 1: Airline revenues entered the red, national revenue passenger miles reduced by 20%, 17% and 12% over next 3 months.
 * Indirect evidence for part 2: Montly miles driven in those 3 months was at least 2% higher than before, with largest increase on rural highways (consistent with long-distance travel)
 * Indirect evidence for part 3: Road fatalities had a stable pattern prior to 9/11 but in the above 3 months (post 9/11) this conformity did not hold. Instead, estimates place the cost at about 350 "more" lives lost due to dread risk avoidance.

 * Takeaway: Dread risks incur visible high costs. Fear of dread risks incurs a second silent cost as people take avoidance measures. This second psychologically-motivated toll should be easier and cheaper to avoid (compared to preventing the occurence of the dread risk itself) by simply educating the public.
