# Lecture 2: The Psychology Of Money

## Opportunity Cost (12:20)
 - A measure of what we give up by choosing one thing over another
 - In money terms, a reflection of what we can't buy in the future because of what we bought today.
 - Also referred to as the _shadow value_ of money
 - Kids are the ultimate opportunity cost

#### Car Dealership Experiment
 - People buying cars asked what they were giving up in exchange
 - No one had thought about purchase in these terms before
 - When pressed, used substitution within category (gave up Honda for Toyota)

People don't understand opportunity cost because it's hard to visualize and compare across time or category. When we try to do so, we use short-cuts to justify decisions.

#### Do we really understand how money works?
 - Envision a world without money. Result would be bartering systems.
 - Money allows more efficient operation of markets by providing common substrate
 - The way money "works" in our current environment also makes it more difficult

#### Envelope of Money Experiment
 - Imagine you have a fixed amount of money to spend each week. How would you plan to spend it?
 - Tradeoff decisions occur more as the week winds down. The "1 week" is a horizon within which decisions are taken which allows people to plan.
 - What happens when we extend the concept to a "year"? Now the horizon is more tenuous and it's harder to understand tradeoffs.

Tradeoffs are obscured in our complicated economy where the "horizon" for a decision is invisible or shifting.

#### Sony vs. Pioneer Purchase Experiment
 - Given a choice between $700 Sony and $1000 Pioneer stereo, more people pick Pioneer.
 - Now, given a choice between a $1000 Sony with "$300 of free CDs" (effectively $700), more people pick Sony.
 - Why? Because in case 1, the tradeoff was cost vs. quality and cost (money) is too abstract for people to evaluate or get excited about. In case 2, the tradeoff shifted to content vs. quality (for same price) -- now people could evaluate across two tangible benefits and find something to get excited about.

 Money is too "abstract" for people to visualize and use in opportunity costs. When money is mapped onto real/tangible things, people find it easier to understand the opportunity cost of picking one over the other.

#### Coffee Experiment
 - Price for capuccino is $3.00 -- can I get you to do something for me for a capuccino, that you wouldn't do for me if I gave you $3.00 directly.
 - So representation of a capuccino is worth more than $3 - the first has more emotional appeal.

 We place a higher value on specific items than on the monetary value of those items.



## Relativity (7:24)

Thinking about money in relative vs. absolute terms is one trick people play to justify opportunity costs.

#### Pen Experiment
 - You purchase a pen. Cashier tells you the same pen is available at competitor 3 blocks down for $8 less.
 - Would you say yes or no? Most say "yes"
 - Now you purchase a camera. Cashier tells you the same pen is available at competitor 3 blocks down for $8 less.
 - Would you say yes or no? Most say "no"

The effective effort vs. savings is the same ($8) but to our perceptions they are different. Compared to the absolute cost of the item, the "relative" savings seem less worthwhile in the camera.

Similarly:

- (Leather Cost) using $2000 with leather for car seats vs. leather for office chairs.
Chair is used more, but you are less likely to agree to upgrade there.
- (Renovation) spend lots of money on more expensive tile (snap decision) but think hard about spending extra on more expensive tomatoes at grocery on the same day.

#### Happiness Factor
- Would you rather earn $90K and be lowest earner in one company or earl $85K and be the highest earner in another?
- Most people choose the first when asked what they prefer, but choose the second when asked where they would be _happier_ (satisfaction influenced by comparison to coworkers)
- We are not willing to pay a premium for happiness

Diminishing returns -- the psychological effects of monetary amounts curve flattens after an initial exponential rise. This is why $8 at the lower end of scale maps to a much higher psychological intensity than an $8 differential at higher end of purchase cost.



## The Pain of Paying (14:32)

Scenario: You go to dinner. Options to pay with credit or cash -- which feels worse?
Answer: Cash

The agony of parting with our money has to do with saliency (is this money going away) and the timing of it (is the money going _at the same time_ as the consumption of paid-for goods?)

Scenario: I charge you 50 cents per bite, and charge you only for the bites you eat.
 * Is this a financially-efficient meal? Yes - we know exactly what we owe at all times
 * Is this a fun meal? No (example of PhD students taking large bites but being miserable)

Scenario: You go for a cruise. You can pay in advance, or pay the moment you get off the boat.
 * Option 2 is more economically-efficient but how do you feel through the cruise?
 * You try to overindulge to justify the cost, you think about it every day..

The pain of paying adds a _moral tax_ and a saliency (how much attention we pay to it) that can impact the pleasure of purchase.
Example:
 * Salience when paying for gasoline. You can see the money ticking as you fill gas, giving you incredibly large pain in paying. Similarly, for cabs.
 * Electricity also charged per use but now you pay once at the end of the month, by credit card. Less pain of paying.

Are there times we want to *feel* the pain of paying?? If so, to increase the pain of paying
 * use cash
 * receive notification whenever money is spent
 * increase salience


Prepayment can focus our attention on the enjoyment of the experience
 * Example: When going on a vacation, an "all-expenses paid" trip where you don't have to think about paying per-drink, per-ride etc. has more enjoyment than paying as you go
 * Example (my own): Amusement parks where you pay once for all rides, rather than per-ride. It is not economically efficient (you don't get to really go on all the rides) but your enjoyment is greater.

What is an ideal gift?? What are the characteristics?
 * It removes the "pain of paying" from the recipient
 * Imagine you see a hat and love it, but it's too expensive so you don't buy it. Now your spouse bought the hat for you from your joint checking account. Do you ask him to return it? (Majority of surveyed people chose to keep the hat)

The Pain of Paying involves
 - opportunity cost
 - hassle component
 - moral tax (guilt associated with payment)
 - method of payment (credit card vs cash)
 - timing of payment (before, during, after)

We experience less pain of paying when the _form_ of paymen is distanced from the pure representation of money
Example:
 * Cash in money at casino for "chips"
 * Now your pain of payment in using/losing chips is less because you have subconsciously altered it to be something "allocated" for the enjoyment of the casino

Pre-paid money in a certain category is easy to spend (e.g., Gift Cards)

Example: AOL moved from tiered rate ($19.95 for 20 hrs + $2.95/hr after) to a flat rate ($19.95 for unlimited use). How many people would start using more data/modems?
 * Distribution curve: was originally bell shaped (people vs. hours-online) with very few people using more than 25 hours per month _initially_
 * Speculation: They speculated that those who used more than 20 hrs anyway were basically having the marginal cost (i.e., extra per-hour) amortized and would be the big winners. And they speculated that those who used 19 hours could be keeping a buffer, and potentially increase their usage -- but those who used much less (e.g., 10 hrs) would not be affected since they had a lot of unused capacity indicative of unuse.
 * Based on this they increased capacity by a tiny amount.
 * What really happened? Demand quadrupled.
 * Why? Because AOL had an onscreen 'clock' that showed you the pain of paying all the time. Now no one felt that pain anymore -- so everyone started consuming without thinking.
