# Terminology

Quick reference for relevant terminology or concepts. A good secondary resource is the excellent set of [flash cards](http://quizlet.com/23020804/behavioral-economics-glossary-all-may-2013-flash-cards/) created by a peer participant on this course. Another set can be found [here] (http://quizlet.com/16883213/behavioral-economics-flash-cards/)

 * Note: some terms/explanations below were obtained from the referenced lists for completeness, particularly when they did not have explicit context/references in lectures
 * Some explanations below were also obtained directly from Wikipedia because of its concise and clear articulation of that concept. Where useful, I have added context to link them to lectures/readings.
 * Where possible, each term has a parenthesized label linking it to the appropriate lecture/week

* *Action control theory*.

* *Affect*. (Emotion) Refers to the experience of feeling or emotion, the intuitive sense that something is good or bad. It indicates an instinctive reaction to stimuli that occurs befroe cognitive processes engage to deliver more complex emotional feedback. As such, affect is a key contributor to human's decision-making processes.


* *Anchoring*. (Irrationality) Also called "focalism". It is a cognitive bias that occurs during decision-making, where humans place more importance on the first piece of information provided (the "anchor"), often using this to influence or bias subsequent judgements.
     * Experiments show that this anchor data can be completely unrelated to the subject at hand; rather, it just provides subconscious focus.
     * Ex: students were asked to use the last 2 digits of their SSN as their bidding price for a product; subsequently, revised bids showed tendency to reflect that 'anchor' bias despite the lack of correlation between an SSN and the retail price of that product.


* *Affective Forecasting*. (Emotion) Unlike animals, people try to "predict" their future states and level of hedonic impacts in each, and try to take actions to bring about desirable states (or avoid undesirable ones). See Hedonic Adaptation, Region Beta Paradox.


* *Asymmetric Dominance*.


* *Choice Architecture*.


* *Cognitive Bias*.


* *Cognitive Dissonance.*


* *Coherent Arbitrariness*.


* *ContraFreeloading*.


* *Counteractive Control*.


* *Counterfactual Thinking*. (Self-Control) is a term of psychology that describes the tendency people have to imagine alternatives to reality (i.e., contrary to facts). Humans are predisposed to think about how things could have turned out differently if only..., and also to imagine what if?. Counterfactuals are conditional propositions, containing an antecedent and a consequence (e.g., If Matt had run, he would have caught the bus.) They can involve both positive and negative scenarios, triggering emotions like relief, guilt, satisfaction, regret etc., which can be motivators (or demotivators) in context. See Reward Substitution and Regret Lottery.


* *Decoy Effect*.


* *Deterrence Hypothesis*.


* *Dread Risk*. Low-probabilty, high-consequence events such as 9/11 where many people's lives are lost in a single moment rather than in a distributed manner over time


* *Dual Process Theory*. (Emotion) People view reality in two different ways: System 1 (experiential, intuitive) and System 2 (rational, analytical) where affective bias is a key characteristic of System 1 perceptions.

* *Divestiture Aversion*. See Endowment Effect.


* *Ego Depletion.* (Self Control) When we continually exert self-control, our ability to resist temptation weakens


* *Endowment Effect*. (Self-Control) Also called Divestiture Aversion. It is the hypothesis that a person's willingness to accept (WTA) compensation for a good is greater than their willingness to pay (WTP) for it once their property right to it has been established. People will pay more to *retain* something they own than to *obtain* something owned by someone elseâ€”even when there is no cause for attachment, or even if the item was only obtained minutes ago. Also see Loss Aversion.


* *Expected Utility*. Also called "anticipated utility".


* *Fudge Factor*.

* *Happiness.* (Self-Control) We pick a reality and compare our lives to it. If that reality is better than our actual lives, we are miserable. If that reality is worse, we feel good.

* *Hedonic Treadmill or Hedonic Adaptation*. (Emotion) Refers to the tendency of humans to return quickly to a stable state of emotion after potentially significant or life-changing positive or negative events. See Region Beta Paradox.

* *Herding*.


* *Heuristic.*


* *Identifiable Victim Effect*. (Emotion) A single, specific victim inspires action but general information about masses does not (the statistical vs. identifiable life).


* *IKEA Effect*. Also see Not-Invented-Here Bias.


* *Intertemporal Discounting*. (Emotion)


* *Intra-Empathy Mismatch*. (Emotion) We find it harder to predict/reconcile our future decisions (under a different emotional state) with our current thinking.


* *Loss Aversion*. Refers to people's tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains. Some studies suggest that losses are twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains. This in turn may explain why people may be willing to pay more to retain things they already own than to obtain a new item -- see Endowment Effect.


* *Macbeth Effect*. (Dishonesty)


* *Marginal Cost*.


* *Not Invented Here Bias*.


* *Pain of Paying*. (Psychology of Money) Reflects the agony we feel when we part with our money and is amplified by saliency (can we 'see' the money going away) and timing (how closely is payment coupled to the consumption experience). Key components of PoP:
     * Moral Tax of consumption: the guilt we feel when we spend hard-earned money
     * Format of payment: related to saliency, representation of payment matters - cash hurts more than credit card or casino chips
     * Timing of payment: post-pay vs. pre-pay (cruise), per-bite vs. per-meal (restaurant) - former is financially good but hurts more
     * Opportunity cost
     * Hassle component


* *Present Focus Bias*. (Self-Control) Tendency to give more weight to our current environment or state.


* *Prospect Theory*.


* *Region Beta Paradox*. (Emotion) Phenomenon (described by Daniel Gilbert) where active response mechanisms kick in when some critical threshold is passed, causing a time-distance paradox where we may take more time to reach a closer target than we would a distant one. Example 1: When travelling, we may choose to "walk" to a close destination but drive to a distant one; ergo we may get to the further destination earlier. Example 2: (related to affective forecasting) more intense joy/distress emotions are attenuated faster than tepid ones; ergo we may get over spousal infidelity faster than over spousal disorderliness.

* *Regret.* (Self-Control) The comparison between where we are in life and where we could have been. See Happiness.

* *Regret Lottery*. (Self-Control). Regret builds on loss aversion and counterfactual thinking by creating a strong sense of 'what if' or 'if only' that can in turn provide motivation. Regret lottery uses regret as a reward substitution measure, entering people in a lottery and notifying them of a win but only allowing them to *claim* the reward if they had performed a specific task (e.g., medication adherence) that required self-control.


* *Reward Substitution*. (Self-Control) Phenomenon where we use an *alternative* reward that has immediate impact (and is therefore more motivating) to influence decisions. This is particularly true in cases where we face a decision that has short-term pain and long-term gain, where we discount the long-term default reward (because of the time component) and focus only on short-term discomforts.

* *Self-Herding*.


* *Status Quo Bias*.


* *Visceral Factors*. (Emotion) Refers to rapidly-changing high-intensity states (encompassing negative emotions, drive states and feeling states) that can override a user's stated preference or cognitively-planned action in the short-term, and should therefore be considered a factor in computing utility in decision-making processes. Humans tend to under-estimate the impact of VF on future actions. See Intra-Empathy Mismatch.
