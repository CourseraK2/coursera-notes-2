# Terminology

Quick reference for relevant terminology or concepts.

* **Affective Forecasting**. People predict (incorrectly) that effects of happiness or misery will be long-lasting. In reality, emotion adaptation ensures we return to a base/normal emotional state quite quickly.

* **Dread Risk**. Low-probabilty, high-consequence events such as 9/11 where many people's lives are lost in a single moment rather than in a distributed manner over time

* **Identifiable Victim Effect**. A single, specific victim inspires action but general information about masses does not (the statistical vs. identifiable life).

* **Intra-Empathy Mismatch**. We find it harder to predict/reconcile our future decisions (under a different emotional state) with our current thinking.
