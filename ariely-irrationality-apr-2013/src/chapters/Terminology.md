# Terminology

Quick reference for relevant terminology or concepts. A good secondary resource is the excellent set of [flash cards](http://quizlet.com/23020804/behavioral-economics-glossary-all-may-2013-flash-cards/) created by a peer participant on this course. Another set can be found [here] (http://quizlet.com/16883213/behavioral-economics-flash-cards/)

* *Action control theory*.


* *Affect*. (Emotion) Refers to the experience of feeling or emotion, the intuitive sense that something is good or bad. It indicates an instinctive reaction to stimuli that occurs befroe cognitive processes engage to deliver more complex emotional feedback. As such, affect is a key contributor to human's decision-making processes.


* *Anchoring*. (Irrationality) Also called "focalism". It is a cognitive bias that occurs during decision-making, where humans place more importance on the first piece of information provided (the "anchor"), often using this to influence or bias subsequent judgements.
     * Experiments show that this anchor data can be completely unrelated to the subject at hand; rather, it just provides subconscious focus.
     * Ex: students were asked to use the last 2 digits of their SSN as their bidding price for a product; subsequently, revised bids showed tendency to reflect that 'anchor' bias despite the lack of correlation between an SSN and the retail price of that product.


* *Affective Forecasting*. (Emotion) Unlike animals, people try to "predict" their future states and level of hedonic impacts in each, and try to take actions to bring about desirable states (or avoid undesirable ones). See Hedonic Adaptation, Region Beta Paradox.


* *Asymmetric Dominance*. (Irrationality) In marketing, the decoy effect (or asymmetric dominance effect) is the phenomenon whereby consumers will tend to have a specific change in preference between two options when also presented with a third option that is asymmetrically dominated. An option is asymmetrically dominated when it is inferior in all respects to one option; but, in comparison to the other option, it is inferior in some respects and superior in others. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoy_Effect) Also see Decoy Effect.


* *Choice Architecture*.


* *Cognitive Bias*.


* *Cognitive Dissonance.* (Labor/Motivation) Tension that occurs when there is a mismatch between our beliefs/ideas/values and our behaviors/emotional-reactions. In a state of dissonance, people may sometimes feel "disequilibrium": frustration, hunger, dread, guilt, anger, embarrassment, anxiety, etc. In social psychology, this proposes that people have a motivational drive to reduce dissonance by altering existing cognitions, adding new ones to create a consistent belief system, or alternatively by reducing the importance of any one of the dissonant elements. Thus, a person may try to 'rationalize' a decision/choice that doesn't fit their current beliefts by introducing a new aspect to the equation -- Zappos employees who turn down more money to take the job rationalize this as being really passionate about working for Zappos. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance)


* *Coherent Arbitrariness*.


* *ContraFreeloading*. (Labor/Motivation) The behavior first observed in animals (rats) where, given the choice between eating food provided to them directly (free) or putting in some effort to get it themselves (e.g., pressing a lever), they ate the most from the source that required them to work. In essence, it speaks to a preference for


* *Counteractive Control*.


* *Counterfactual Thinking*. (Self-Control) is a term of psychology that describes the tendency people have to imagine alternatives to reality (i.e., contrary to facts). Humans are predisposed to think about how things could have turned out differently if only..., and also to imagine what if?. Counterfactuals are conditional propositions, containing an antecedent and a consequence (e.g., If Matt had run, he would have caught the bus.) They can involve both positive and negative scenarios, triggering emotions like relief, guilt, satisfaction, regret etc., which can be motivators (or demotivators) in context. See Reward Substitution and Regret Lottery.


* *Decoy Effect*. (Irrationality)  When the asymmetrically dominated option is present, a higher percentage of consumers will prefer the dominating option than when the asymmetrically dominated option is absent. The asymmetrically dominated option is therefore a decoy serving to increase preference for the dominating option. In short, given a Target option (you want users to pick) and a Competitor option, it is possible to influence humans to pick the Target by introducing a third Decoy option that is asymmetrically dominated by the Target. Examples include pricing subscriptions or selecting 'wing-men' for dating. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoy_Effect) Also see Asymmetric Dominance.


* *Decision Illusion*. (Irrationality) Also see Inattentional Blindness.


* *Deterrence Hypothesis*. (Labor/Motivation) Predicts that the introduction of a penalty that leaves eveything *else* unchanged will reduce the occurence of the behavior that was subject to a fine. It speaks to a theory in behavior psychology that advocates controlling or preventing behaviors through fear of punishment or retribution. The key here that the "leave everything else unchanged" is hard to enforce in reality, leading to cases (e.g., parents fine for late pick-up at daycare) where fines backfired by taking an incompletely specified social contract and converting it to a clear monetary obligation [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_(psychology))


* *Discounting.* (Self-Control) Given 2 similar rewards, humans prefer the one that arrives sooner and "discount" the value of the one that arrives later, where discount increases with the length of the delay. See Hyperbolic Discounting.


* *Dread Risk*. (Emotion) Low-probabilty, high-consequence events such as 9/11 where many people's lives are lost in a single moment rather than in a distributed manner over time


* *Dual Process Theory*. (Emotion) People view reality in two different ways: System 1 (experiential, intuitive) and System 2 (rational, analytical) where affective bias is a key characteristic of System 1 perceptions.


* *Divestiture Aversion*. See Endowment Effect.


* *Ego Depletion.* (Self Control) When we continually exert self-control, our ability to resist temptation weakens


* *Endowment Effect*. (Self-Control) Also called Divestiture Aversion. It is the hypothesis that a person's willingness to accept (WTA) compensation for a good is greater than their willingness to pay (WTP) for it once their property right to it has been established. People will pay more to *retain* something they own than to *obtain* something owned by someone elseâ€”even when there is no cause for attachment, or even if the item was only obtained minutes ago. Also see Loss Aversion. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect)


* *Expected Utility*. Also called "anticipated utility".


* *Fudge Factor*.


* *Happiness.* (Self-Control) We pick a reality and compare our lives to it. If that reality is better than our actual lives, we are miserable. If that reality is worse, we feel good.


* *Hedonic Treadmill or Hedonic Adaptation*. (Emotion) Refers to the tendency of humans to return quickly to a stable state of emotion after potentially significant or life-changing positive or negative events. See Region Beta Paradox. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill)


* *Herding*.


* *Hyperbolic Discounting.* (Self-Control) A form of time-inconsistent reward discounting where the discount rate falls more rapidly for short-term (present) evaluations and more slowly for long-term (distant future). This leads to situations where given 2 rewards separated by a fixed time duration, humans make different decisions if the reward selection is for the present, and when the reward selection is set in a distant future. Note: Exponential discounting assumes a constant discount (time-consistent) rate - experiments have shown this is not the case for humans/animals, leading to the inclusion of this effect in irrationality in decision-making. Also see Discounting and Present Focus Bias.

* *Heuristic.*


* *Inattentional Blindness.* (Irrationality) Inattentional blindness is the failure to notice an unexpected stimulus that is in one's field of vision when other attention-demanding tasks are being performed. It often happens when humans are overloaded with stimuli and is due to the fact that the human is then unaware of the unattended stimuli. (The Invisible Gorilla experiment) [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inattentional_blindness) See Decision Illusions


* *Identifiable Victim Effect*. (Emotion) A single, specific victim inspires action but general information about masses does not (the statistical vs. identifiable life). Refers to the tendency of individuals to offer greater aid when a specific, identifiable person ("victim") is observed under hardship, as compared to a large, vaguely defined group with the same need. (Even small groups moved the focus from identifiable life to statistical life, causing reduced emotive response) The effect is also observed when subjects administer punishment rather than reward. Participants in a study were more likely to mete out punishment, even at their own expense, when they were punishing specific, identifiable individuals ("perpetrators"). [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifiable_victim_effect)


* *IKEA Effect*. (Labor/Motivation) The Ikea effect is a cognitive bias where labor enhances affection for its results Also see Not-Invented-Here Bias. The nature of the "Ikea effect" is the result of over admiration of a particular item one puts together on their own. It is seen as an actual psychological situation which is linked to consumer placing an overload of value towards an object they built even though it is not worth as much as they believe.[Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikea_Effect)


* *Incomplete Contracts*. (Labor/Motivation) Referenced in reading "A Fine is Price", it indicates the existence of a contract with missing details (e.g., on conditions, penalties) that allows for incorrect or vague interpretations by the contractor, and can lead to establishment or reinforcement of new behaviors/provisions in consequence. For instance, in "A Fine is Price" the initial penalty for coming late was not quantified, allowing parents to view it as a vague social obligation and interpret it however they chose. See Deterrence Hypothesis.


* *Intertemporal Discounting*. (Emotion) Temporal discounting refers to the tendency to give greater value to rewards as they move away from their temporal horizons and towards the "now". Intertemporal discounting is the study of the *relative* value people assign to two different choices based on the payoffs/rewards being associated with them at two different points in time. In essence, it requires humans to make trade-offs in cost-vs-benefit at two distinct points in time. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertemporal_choice) Also see Hyperbolic Discounting.


* *Intra-Empathy Mismatch*. (Emotion) We find it harder to predict/reconcile our future decisions (under a different emotional state) with our current thinking.


* *Loss Aversion*. (Psychology of Money) Refers to people's tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains. Some studies suggest that losses are twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains. This in turn may explain why people may be willing to pay more to retain things they already own than to obtain a new item -- see Endowment Effect. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion)


* *Macbeth Effect*. (Dishonesty)


* *Marginal Cost*.


* *Not Invented Here Bias*. (Labor/Motivation) Refers to people's tendency to prefer their own creations to those of others, for various reasons (including vested labor). On the pro side, this is a huge motivator for labor; on the con side, it may blind us to better alternatives. As a social phenomenon, this philosophy manifests as an unwillingness to adopt an idea or product because it originates from another culture. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) See Ikea Effect.


* *Pain of Paying*. (Psychology of Money) Reflects the agony we feel when we part with our money and is amplified by saliency (can we 'see' the money going away) and timing (how closely is payment coupled to the consumption experience). Key components of PoP:
     * Moral Tax of consumption: the guilt we feel when we spend hard-earned money
     * Format of payment: related to saliency, representation of payment matters - cash hurts more than credit card or casino chips
     * Timing of payment: post-pay vs. pre-pay (cruise), per-bite vs. per-meal (restaurant) - former is financially good but hurts more
     * Opportunity cost
     * Hassle component


* *Present Focus Bias*. (Self-Control) Tendency to give more weight to our current environment or state. Also see Hyperbolic Discounting.


* *Prospect Theory*. (Emotion) refers to decision-making under uncertainity, describing how people choose between probabilistic alternatives that involve risk, where probabilities of the outcomes are known. The theory states that people make decisions based on the potential value of losses/gains in each outcome rather than on the final outcome alone, and that these losses/gains are evaluated using a heuristic (which can be subjective). In the context of Human Life (see PsychoPhysical Numbing) this may explain why people take swifter action for smaller tragedies and not mass atrocities; the value of a specific number of lives is greater (proportionately) in the former than the latter. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory)


* *Psychophysical Numbing*: (Emotion) reflects our inability to appreciate losses of life as they become larger in magnitude.


* *Region Beta Paradox*. (Emotion) Phenomenon (described by Daniel Gilbert) where active response mechanisms kick in when some critical threshold is passed, causing a time-distance paradox where we may take more time to reach a closer target than we would a distant one. Example 1: When travelling, we may choose to "walk" to a close destination but drive to a distant one; ergo we may get to the further destination earlier. Example 2: (related to affective forecasting) more intense joy/distress emotions are attenuated faster than tepid ones; ergo we may get over spousal infidelity faster than over spousal disorderliness.


* *Regret.* (Self-Control) The comparison between where we are in life and where we could have been. See Happiness.


* *Regret Lottery*. (Self-Control). Regret builds on loss aversion and counterfactual thinking by creating a strong sense of 'what if' or 'if only' that can in turn provide motivation. Regret lottery uses regret as a reward substitution measure, entering people in a lottery and notifying them of a win but only allowing them to *claim* the reward if they had performed a specific task (e.g., medication adherence) that required self-control.


* *Reward Substitution*. (Self-Control) Phenomenon where we use an *alternative* reward that has immediate impact (and is therefore more motivating) to influence decisions. This is particularly true in cases where we face a decision that has short-term pain and long-term gain, where we discount the long-term default reward (because of the time component) and focus only on short-term discomforts.


* *Self-Herding*.


* *Status Quo Bias*.


* *Temporal Discounting*. (Emotion) Temporal discounting refers to the tendency of people to discount rewards as they approach a temporal horizon in the future or the past (i.e., become so distant in time that they cease to be valuable or to have additive effects). To put it another way, it is a tendency to give greater value to rewards as they move away from their temporal horizons and towards the "now". It is also called delay discounting or time discounting. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_discounting) Also see InterTemporal Discounting.


* *Visceral Factors*. (Emotion) Refers to rapidly-changing high-intensity states (encompassing negative emotions, drive states and feeling states) that can override a user's stated preference or cognitively-planned action in the short-term, and should therefore be considered a factor in computing utility in decision-making processes. Humans tend to under-estimate the impact of VF on future actions. See Intra-Empathy Mismatch.


* *Yerkes-Dodson Law* (Labor/Motivation) is an empirical relationship between arousal and performance, originally developed by psychologists Robert M. Yerkes and John Dillingham Dodson. It dictates that performance increases with physiological or mental arousal -- but only up to a point. After that, increase in arousal levels causes performance to decrease. It also models how monetary/social rewards influence performance only to a point, after which humans seem to "choke" performance-wise. Explanations include the increase in cognitive load/stress caused by the increased pressure/distraction on the performer at this point. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerkes%E2%80%93Dodson_law)
