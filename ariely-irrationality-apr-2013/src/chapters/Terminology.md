# Terminology

Quick reference for relevant terminology or concepts.

* **Affective Forecasting**. Unlike animals, people try to "predict" their future states and level of hedonic impacts in each, and try to take actions to bring about desirable states (or avoid undesirable ones). See Hedonic Adaptation, Region Beta Paradox.

* **Dread Risk**. Low-probabilty, high-consequence events such as 9/11 where many people's lives are lost in a single moment rather than in a distributed manner over time

* **Hedonic Treadmill or Hedonic Adaptation**. Refers to the tendency of humans to return quickly to a stable state of emotion after potentially significant or life-changing positive or negative events. See Region Beta Paradox.

* **Identifiable Victim Effect**. A single, specific victim inspires action but general information about masses does not (the statistical vs. identifiable life).

* **Intra-Empathy Mismatch**. We find it harder to predict/reconcile our future decisions (under a different emotional state) with our current thinking.

* **Region Beta Paradox**. Phenomenon (described by Daniel Gilbert) where active response mechanisms kick in when some critical threshold is passed, causing a time-distance paradox where we may take more time to reach a closer target than we would a distant one. Example 1: When travelling, we may choose to "walk" to a close destination but drive to a distant one; ergo we may get to the further destination earlier. Example 2: (related to affective forecasting) more intense joy/distress emotions are attenuated faster than tepid ones; ergo we may get over spousal infidelity faster than over spousal disorderliness.

* **Visceral Factors**. Refers to rapidly-changing high-intensity states (encompassing negative emotions, drive states and feeling states) that can override a user's stated preference or cognitively-planned action in the short-term, and should therefore be considered a factor in computing utility in decision-making processes. Humans tend to under-estimate the impact of VF on future actions. See Intra-Empathy Mismatch.
