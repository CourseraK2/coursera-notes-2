# Terminology

Quick reference for relevant terminology or concepts. A good secondary resource is the excellent set of [flash cards](http://quizlet.com/23020804/behavioral-economics-glossary-all-may-2013-flash-cards/) created by a peer participant on this course. Another set can be found [here] (http://quizlet.com/16883213/behavioral-economics-flash-cards/) I replicated some terms in this list for convenience and completeness, but added or revised the explanation to reflect my understanding.

* *Action control theory*.

* *Affect*. (Emotion) Refers to the experience of feeling or emotion, the intuitive sense that something is good or bad. It indicates an instinctive reaction to stimuli that occurs befroe cognitive processes engage to deliver more complex emotional feedback. As such, affect is a key contributor to human's decision-making processes.

* *Anchoring*. (Irrationality) Also called "focalism". It is a cognitive bias that occurs during decision-making, where humans place more importance on the first piece of information provided (the "anchor"), often using this to influence or bias subsequent judgements.
     * Experiments show that this anchor data can be completely unrelated to the subject at hand; rather, it just provides subconscious focus.
     * Ex: students were asked to use the last 2 digits of their SSN as their bidding price for a product; subsequently, revised bids showed tendency to reflect that 'anchor' bias despite the lack of correlation between an SSN and the retail price of that product.


* *Affective Forecasting*. (Emotion) Unlike animals, people try to "predict" their future states and level of hedonic impacts in each, and try to take actions to bring about desirable states (or avoid undesirable ones). See Hedonic Adaptation, Region Beta Paradox.


* *Asymmetric Dominance*.


* *Choice Architecture*.


* *Cognitive Bias*.


* *Cognitive Dissonance.*


* *Coherent Arbitrariness*.


* *ContraFreeloading*.


* *Counteractive Control*.


* *Counterfactual Thinking*.


* *Decoy Effect*.


* *Deterrence Hypothesis*.


* *Dread Risk*. Low-probabilty, high-consequence events such as 9/11 where many people's lives are lost in a single moment rather than in a distributed manner over time


* *Dual Process Theory*. (Emotion) People view reality in two different ways: System 1 (experiential, intuitive) and System 2 (rational, analytical) where affective bias is a key characteristic of System 1 perceptions.

* *Ego Depletion.*


* *Endowment Effect*.


* *Expected Utility*. Also called "anticipated utility".


* *Fudge Factor*.


* *Hedonic Treadmill or Hedonic Adaptation*. (Emotion) Refers to the tendency of humans to return quickly to a stable state of emotion after potentially significant or life-changing positive or negative events. See Region Beta Paradox.

* *Herding*.


* *Heuristic.*


* *Identifiable Victim Effect*. (Emotion) A single, specific victim inspires action but general information about masses does not (the statistical vs. identifiable life).


* *IKEA Effect*. Also see Not-Invented-Here Bias.


* *Intertemporal Discounting*. (Emotion)


* *Intra-Empathy Mismatch*. (Emotion) We find it harder to predict/reconcile our future decisions (under a different emotional state) with our current thinking.


* *Loss Aversion*.


* *Macbeth Effect*. (Dishonesty)


* *Marginal Cost*.


* *Not Invented Here Bias*.


* *Pain of Paying*. (Psychology of Money) Reflects the agony we feel when we part with our money and is amplified by saliency (can we 'see' the money going away) and timing (how closely is payment coupled to the consumption experience). Key components of PoP:
     * Moral Tax of consumption: the guilt we feel when we spend hard-earned money
     * Format of payment: related to saliency, representation of payment matters - cash hurts more than credit card or casino chips
     * Timing of payment: post-pay vs. pre-pay (cruise), per-bite vs. per-meal (restaurant) - former is financially good but hurts more
     * Opportunity cost
     * Hassle component


* *Prospect Theory*.


* *Region Beta Paradox*. (Emotion) Phenomenon (described by Daniel Gilbert) where active response mechanisms kick in when some critical threshold is passed, causing a time-distance paradox where we may take more time to reach a closer target than we would a distant one. Example 1: When travelling, we may choose to "walk" to a close destination but drive to a distant one; ergo we may get to the further destination earlier. Example 2: (related to affective forecasting) more intense joy/distress emotions are attenuated faster than tepid ones; ergo we may get over spousal infidelity faster than over spousal disorderliness.


* *Self-Herding*.


* *Status Quo Bias*.


* *Visceral Factors*. (Emotion) Refers to rapidly-changing high-intensity states (encompassing negative emotions, drive states and feeling states) that can override a user's stated preference or cognitively-planned action in the short-term, and should therefore be considered a factor in computing utility in decision-making processes. Humans tend to under-estimate the impact of VF on future actions. See Intra-Empathy Mismatch.
