### About Web Book Boilerplate

(Retained from boilerplate text for wbb)

With the Web Book Boilerplate you have the perfect place to start writing your book!
It uses plain old markdown and generates a well structured HTML version of your written
words. Since it's sitting on top of [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) and
[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com), you can easily make your books available for every platform!

The Web Book Boilerplate is also compatible with [Leanpub](http://leanpub.com), so
even publishing your books works like a charm.
